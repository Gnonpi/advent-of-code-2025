# advent-of-code-2025

This year, my goals are:
* try and actually solve the 12 puzzles:
  since it's shorter, it might be possible, but I have a professional trip next week, it might not
* try and do most of it with [Gleam](gleam.run):
  it looks like a nice language, but if I'm running late, I have the right to switch to Python
