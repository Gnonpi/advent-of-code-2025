# advent-of-code-2025

This year, my goal is ~to use [Gleam](gleam.run)~ try and be consistent.

Let's keep to Python all the time, it'll be easier.

## Installing

I've got `pyenv` in local plus a virtualenv, no need for production quality dependency management.

There's a pre-commit file, running via prek.

When I want to run the code of one day,
I just do `venv/bin/python dayX/solution_day.py`.

## Templating

That's something I'd like to improve,
but for now, I've prepared a small dir to copy for each day
(stolen from 2023 me).
